        <p><h2>Hamburger Casserole Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>Â½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
                <li>Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover the skillet. </li>
                <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain. </li>
                <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish. </li>
                <li>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the sour cream mixture, then 1/2 of the ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. </li>
            </ol>
